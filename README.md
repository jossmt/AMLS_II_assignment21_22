###### The model can be executed by running the notebook in Google Colab (ensure to upload the competition data to the same directory as the notebook). In order to run task A simply execute the notebook with task parameter set to 'A', otherwise set the task parameter to 'B' to run the model for task B.

Note: The model was unfortunately built using jupyter notebooks in google colab and the results were re-run at the final hour, so the model has not been transformed into an executable python script in time.
